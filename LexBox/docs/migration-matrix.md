## Remaining External Dependencies

These are runtime/provider dependencies, not missing IPC routes:

- WeChat official remote draft requires valid account credentials and media upload permission.
- Weixin sidecar behavior depends on the configured external sidecar command and JSON state output.
- Video generation providers may need per-provider polling endpoints beyond common `statusUrl`/`taskId` conventions.
- Model-backed features need configured, reachable provider endpoints.

## Verification Baseline

- IPC channel diff: no missing frontend channels in Rust host.
- `cargo fmt --check && cargo check`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm tauri build --debug`
- Short debug-binary smoke startup
